            <h2>The Space Race Begins</h2>
            <p>After WW2 the United states and the Soviet Union were at odds during the cold war as the threat of nuclear war loomed. On July 30, 1955 the U.S. announced they would be launching artificial satellites for the international geophysical year. Four days later the USSR declared they would launch a satellite “in the near future”. This was the beginning of the space race.</p>

            <h2>Sputnik</h2>
            <p>On October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched an R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile carrying an artificial satellite named Sputnik. The first man made object to be placed into the earths orbit. This launch came at a surprise to the Americans and gained lots of public attention, not only was it morale blow to lose ground to Soviets it also was a security threat as these new powerful missiles would also be capable of carrying nuclear warheads. And the idea of a Soviet satellite floating in space unchecked was unnerving to most.</p>

            <p>After the failed launch of project Vanguard on December 6, 1957 which was widely ridiculed and mocked, The US successfully launched its first satellite Explorer 1 into orbit from Cape Canaveral on January 31, 1958. Three months later president Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a government agency specifically for space exploration.</p>

            <p>April 12, 1961, the Soviets launched Vostok 1 and Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit the earth. Three weeks later on May 5, Alan Shepard became the first American in space although he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin. This would be achieved by Virgil Grissom on July 21, 1961.</p>
